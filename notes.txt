Code is now in the 'src' folder.
arch.h has been split out into multiple files (one per architecture),
in the 'arch' folder. There's still an arch.h file, but it mostly
#includes the device-specific headers and then defaults any undefined
items at the end.

A few functions have been renamed:

_PM_free(Protomatter_core *) is now _PM_deallocate(Protomatter_core *)
_PM_setReg(bit) is now _PM_setBit(bit)
_PM_clearReg(bit) is now _PM_clearBit(bit)
_PM_ALLOCATOR(size) is now _PM_allocate(size)
_PM_FREE(addr) is now _PM_free(addr)

_PM_timerStart() now accepts two tick intervals. First is the overflow
interval (when the per-bitplane switchover occurs), as before. Second is
when the matrix OE line is de-asserted, if this needs to occur before the
overflow interval (e.g. when brightness scaling or for gamma correction).
Most architectures will ignore the second value for now because the
necessary interrupt changes have not been made yet. Only SAMD51 uses it.
If the second interval arg is omitted, the early OE de-assert does not
occur, and the normal brief OE de-assert occurs in the bitplane switchover.
