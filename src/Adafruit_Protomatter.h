  /*!
    @brief  Adafruit_Protomatter constructor.
    @param  bitWidth      Total width of RGB matrix chain, in pixels.
                          Usu. some multiple of 32, but maybe exceptions.
    @param  bitDepth      Color "depth" in bitplanes, determines range of
                          shades of red, green and blue. e.g. passing 4
                          bits = 16 shades ea. R,G,B = 16x16x16 = 4096
                          colors. Max is 6, since the GFX library works
                          with "565" RGB colors (6 bits green, 5 red/blue).
    @param  rgbCount      Number of "sets" of RGB data pins, each set
                          containing 6 pins (2 ea. R,G,B). Typically 1,
                          indicating a single matrix (or matrix chain).
                          In theory (but not yet extensively tested),
                          multiple sets of pins can be driven in parallel,
                          up to 5 on some devices (if the hardware design
                          provides all those bits on one PORT).
    @param  rgbList       A uint8_t array of pins (Arduino pin numbering),
                          6X the prior rgbCount value, corresponding to
                          the 6 output color bits for a matrix (or chain).
                          Order is upper-half red, green, blue, lower-half
                          red, green blue (repeat for each add'l chain).
                          All the RGB pins (plus the clock pin below on
                          some architectures) MUST be on the same PORT
                          register. It's recommended (but not required)
                          that all RGB pins (and clock depending on arch)
                          be within the same byte of a PORT (but do not
                          need to be sequential or contiguous within that
                          byte) for more efficient RAM utilization. For
                          two concurrent chains, same principle but 16-bit
                          word instead of byte.
    @param  addrCount     Number of row address lines required of matrix.
                          Total pixel height is then 2 x 2^addrCount, e.g.
                          32-pixel-tall matrices have 4 row address lines.
    @param  addrList      A uint8_t array of pins (Arduino pin numbering),
                          one per row address line.
    @param  clockPin      RGB clock pin (Arduino pin #).
    @param  latchPin      RGB data latch pin (Arduino pin #).
    @param  oePin         Output enable pin (Arduino pin #), active low.
    @param  doubleBuffer  If true, two matrix buffers are allocated,
                          so changing display contents doesn't introduce
                          artifacts mid-conversion. Requires ~2X RAM.
    @param  tile          If multiple matrices are chained and stacked
                          vertically (rather than or in addition to
                          horizontally), the number of vertical tiles is
                          specified here. Positive values indicate a
                          "progressive" arrangement (always left-to-right),
                          negative for a "serpentine" arrangement (alternating
                          180 degree orientation). Horizontal tiles are implied
                          in the 'bitWidth' argument.
    @param  timer         Pointer to timer peripheral or timer-related
                          struct (architecture-dependent), or NULL to
                          use a default timer ID (also arch-dependent).
