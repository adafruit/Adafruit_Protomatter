/*!
  @brief  Initialize values in Protomatter_core structure.
  @param  core  Pointer to Protomatter_core structure.
  @param  bitWidth      Total width of RGB matrix chain, in pixels.
                        Usu. some multiple of 32, but maybe exceptions.
  @param  bitDepth      Color "depth" in bitplanes, determines range of
                        shades of red, green and blue. e.g. passing 4
                        bits = 16 shades ea. R,G,B = 16x16x16 = 4096
                        colors.
  @param  rgbCount      Number of "sets" of RGB data pins, each set
                        containing 6 pins (2 ea. R,G,B). Typically 1,
                        indicating a single matrix (or matrix chain).
                        In theory (but not yet extensively tested),
                        multiple sets of pins can be driven in parallel,
                        up to 5 on some devices (if the hardware design
                        provides all those bits on one PORT).
  @param  rgbList       A uint8_t array of pins (values are platform-
                        dependent), 6X the prior rgbCount value,
                        corresponding to the 6 output color bits for a
                        matrix (or chain). Order is upper-half red, green,
                        blue, lower-half red, green blue (repeat for each
                        add'l chain). All the RGB pins (plus the clock pin
                        below on some architectures) MUST be on the same
                        PORT register. It's recommended (but not required)
                        that all RGB pins (and clock depending on arch) be
                        within the same byte of a PORT (but do not need to
                        be sequential or contiguous within that byte) for
                        more efficient RAM utilization. For two concurrent
                        chains, same principle but 16-bit word.
  @param  addrCount     Number of row address lines required of matrix.
                        Total pixel height is then 2 x 2^addrCount, e.g.
                        32-pixel-tall matrices have 4 row address lines.
  @param  addrList      A uint8_t array of pins (platform-dependent pin
                        numbering), one per row address line.
  @param  clockPin      RGB clock pin (platform-dependent pin #).
  @param  latchPin      RGB data latch pin (platform-dependent pin #).
  @param  oePin         Output enable pin (platform-dependent pin #),
                        active low.
  @param  doubleBuffer  If true, two matrix buffers are allocated,
                        so changing display contents doesn't introduce
                        artifacts mid-conversion. Requires ~2X RAM.
  @param  tile          If multiple matrices are chained and stacked
                        vertically (rather than or in addition to
                        horizontally), the number of vertical tiles is
                        specified here. Positive values indicate a
                        "progressive" arrangement (always left-to-right),
                        negative for a "serpentine" arrangement (alternating
                        180 degree orientation). Horizontal tiles are implied
                        in the 'bitWidth' argument.
  @param  timer         Pointer to timer peripheral or timer-related
                        struct (architecture-dependent), or NULL to
                        use a default timer ID (also arch-dependent).
  @return A ProtomatterStatus status, one of:
          PROTOMATTER_OK if everything is good.
          PROTOMATTER_ERR_PINS if data and/or clock pins are split across
          different PORTs.
          PROTOMATTER_ERR_MALLOC if insufficient RAM to allocate display
          memory.
          PROTOMATTER_ERR_ARG if a bad value (core or timer pointer) was
          passed in.
